# Hospitality-Revenue-Insights-Dashboard
Developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for AtliQ Grands, a chain of five-star hotels in India. The dashboard provides insights into revenue and booking patterns, enabling data-driven decisions to regain market share. Key features include advanced data modeling, custom measures, and interactive visualizations.

## Project Background:
AtliQ Grands, a luxury hotel chain with a 20-year presence in the hospitality industry across India, is experiencing a decline in market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotel segment. This decline is attributed to strategic maneuvers by competitors and suboptimal management decisions. In response, AtliQ Grands' managing director decided to adopt "Business and Data Intelligence" practices to reclaim their market position. Lacking an in-house data analytics team, they engaged a third-party service provider to analyze their historical data and offer actionable insights.

## Project Objectives:
As a Data Analyst, I developed the Strategic Hospitality Revenue Insights Dashboard using Power BI to provide AtliQ Grands with critical insights from their historical data. This dashboard enables the revenue management team to:
#### a) Analyze Revenue and Booking Patterns: Uncover trends and patterns to support strategic decision-making.
#### b) Provide Actionable Insights: Empower the revenue management team with critical data insights.
#### c) Support Data-Driven Decisions: Utilize data analytics to inform and enhance business strategies.

## Key Highlights:
#### 1) Constructed a Power BI Report: Developed a detailed report to assist the revenue management team with their strategic initiatives.
#### 2) Developed a Data Model: Created a robust data model that includes more than 15 measures to analyze key performance indicators.
#### 3) Performed Revenue and Booking Analysis: Analyzed historical revenue and booking data to identify trends and patterns.
#### 4) Created Visuals and KPIs: Designed various visuals and key performance indicators to highlight critical insights, enabling executives to make informed decisions.

## Key Insights:
#### 1) Booking Patterns: 71% of bookings occur on weekdays, while weekends boast the highest occupancy rate at 53%.
#### 2) Booking Outcomes: 70% of bookings result in successful checkouts, with the remaining 30% either cancelled or unattended.
#### 3) Revenue Performance: Mumbai leads as the top revenue-generating city with ₹640 million, surpassing the combined revenue of Hyderabad and Delhi, with Delhi being the lowest at ₹280 million.
#### 4) Top Performing Hotels: Four out of the top five revenue-generating hotels are located in Mumbai.
#### 5) Popular Room Classes: The elite room class is the most popular, with 47,000 bookings and generating ₹540 million in revenue.
#### 6) Hotel Ratings and Revenue: AtliQ Blu boasts the highest average rating across the chain, while AtliQ Exotica is both the highest-rated and the top revenue-generating hotel.
#### 7) Booking Channels: The majority of bookings (41%) are made through other channels, followed by MakeMyTrip at 20%. The company's website handles 10% of bookings, with direct offline channels contributing the least.
#### 8) Revenue by Category: The luxury category dominates revenue generation with 61%, compared to 39% from the business category.
#### 9) Average Daily Rate (ADR): Mumbai has the highest ADR, whereas Hyderabad has the lowest.
#### 10) No-Show Rate: The overall no-show rate is 5%.

## Conclusion
The Hospitality Analysis Dashboard project aims to equip AtliQ Grands with the necessary business and data intelligence to make informed strategic decisions. By leveraging historical data and advanced analytics, the dashboard delivers comprehensive insights that can drive revenue growth and improve market share in the competitive hospitality industry.
